# HistData

**Data Sets from the History of Statistics and Data Visualization**

The `HistData` package provides a collection of small data sets
that are interesting and important in the history of statistics and data
visualization. The goal of the package is to make these available, both for
instructional use and for historical research. Some of these present interesting
challenges for graphics or analysis in R.

# Pollen Data Challenge

A synthetic dataset generated by David Coleman at RCA Laboratories in
Princeton, N.J and used in the 1986 American Statistical Association JSM
meeting as a data challenge for the Statistical Graphics Section. Some
surprising discoveries were made.

## Format

A data frame with 3848 observations on the following 5 variables,
representing fictitious measurements of grains of pollen.

- `ridge`:

  along X, a numeric vector

- `nub`:

  along y, a numeric vector

- `crack`:

  along z, a numeric vector

- `weight`:

  weight of pollen grain, a numeric vector

- `density`:

  weight of pollen grain, a numeric vector

## Source

The canonical source for this data is the StatLib – Datasets Archive
<https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/pollen.data> in the inconvenient form
of .sh archive.

It is also available as `data(pollen, package="animate")`.

## Details

The first three variables are the lengths of geometric features observed
sampled pollen grains - in the x, y, and z dimensions: a "ridge" along
x, a "nub" in the y direction, and a "crack" in along the z dimension.
The fourth variable is pollen grain weight, and the fifth is density.

In the description for the data challenge: "the data analyst is advised
that there is more than one "feature" to these data. Each feature can be
observed through various graphical techniques, but analytic methods, as
well, can help "crack" the dataset."

There were several features embedded in this dataset: clusters of
points, 5D ellipsoidal voids with no points, and finally, a collection
of points which spelled out "EUREKA".

Papers by Becker et al. (1986) and Slomka (1986) describe their work on
this problem.

Yihui Xie used this data as an illustration of the animate package,
using rgl to zoom in on the magic word. See the video on

## Examples

``` r
data(Pollen)

# All pairwise plots -- just a bunch of blobs?
pairs(Pollen)


# plot ridge vs. nub
plot(nub ~ ridge, data = Pollen, pch = 16)


# zoom in to see the secret
plot(nub ~ ridge, data = Pollen, pch = 16,
     xlim = c(2, -3),
     ylim = c(-1, 2))


```

# Daily Deaths from Cholera and Diarrhaea in England, 1849

Deaths from Cholera and Diarrhaea, for each day of the month of each of
the 12 months of 1849.

This was used by William Farr (GRO & Farr, 1852, Plate 2) to produce a
time series chart of these deaths, in which he also recorded various
meteorological phenomena (barometer, wind, rain), to see if he could
find any patterns. This chart is available on the web site for Friendly
& Wainer (2021) as Fig 4.1,

James Riley (2023) notes, "Cholera 1849 has special significance — it is
likely to be one of few modern pandemics that was completely
unmitigated."

## Usage

``` r
data("CholeraDeaths1849")
```

## Format

A data frame with 730 observations on the following 6 variables.

- `month`:

  a character vector

- `cause_of_death`:

  a factor with levels `Cholera` `Diarrhaea`

- `day_of_month`:

  a character vector

- `deaths`:

  a numeric vector

- `date`:

  a Date

- `day_of_week`:

  an ordered factor with levels `Mon` \< `Tue` \< `Wed` \< `Thu` \<
  `Fri` \< `Sat` \< `Sun`

## Details

The data set was transcribed by James Riley to a spreadsheet,
<https://github.com/jimr1603/1849-cholera>. He notes, "the scan at
Internet Archive has a fold on day 11. I have derived this column from
the row totals."

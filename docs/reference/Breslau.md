# Halley's Breslau Life Table

Edmond Halley published his Breslau life table in 1693, which was
arguably the first in the world based on population data. David
Bellhouse (2011) resurrected the original sources of these data,
collected by Caspar Neumann in the city of Breslau (now called Wroclaw),
and then reconstructed in the 1880s by Jonas Graetzer, the medical
officer in Breslau at that time.

The dataset here follows Graetzer, and gives the number of deaths at
ages `1:100` recorded in each of the years `1687:1691`. Halley's
analysis was based on the total over those years.

## Usage

``` r
data("Breslau")
```

## Format

A data frame with 100 observations on the following 8 variables. The
`yearXXXX` variables give the number of deaths for persons of a given
`age` recorded in that year.

- `age`:

  a numeric vector

- `year1687`:

  a numeric vector

- `year1688`:

  a numeric vector

- `year1689`:

  a numeric vector

- `year1690`:

  a numeric vector

- `year1691`:

  a numeric vector

- `total`:

  a numeric vector

- `average`:

  a numeric vector

## Examples

``` r
data(Breslau)

# Reproduce Figure 1 in Bellhouse (2011)
# He excluded age < 5 and made a point of the over-representation of deaths in quinquennial years.
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
Breslau5 <- Breslau |>
  filter(age >= 5) |>
  mutate(div5 = factor(age %% 5 == 0))

  geom_point(aes(color=div5)) +

  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(x = "Age current at death",
       y = "Total number of deaths") +

\title{
Daily Deaths from Cholera and Diarrhaea in England, 1849
}
\description{
Deaths from Cholera and Diarrhaea, for each day of the month of each of the 12 months of 1849.

This was used by William Farr (GRO & Farr, 1852, Plate 2) to produce a time series chart of these deaths,
in which he also recorded various meteorological phenomena (barometer, wind, rain),
to see if he could find any patterns. This chart is available on the web site
for Friendly & Wainer (2021) as Fig 4.1, \url{https://friendly.github.io/HistDataVis/figs-web/04_1-cholera-diarrhea.png}.

James Riley (2023) notes, "Cholera 1849 has special significance --- it is likely to be one of few modern pandemics that was completely unmitigated."
